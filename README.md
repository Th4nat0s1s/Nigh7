A 7 Days to Die overhaul mod by Th4nat0s1s!

This mod aims to be an overhaul of 7 Days to Die for balancing and adding custom assets; including stacking mods, new weapons, new throwable weapons (hopefully), new  items and so much more!

This project will be a work in progress for the forseeable future due to us finding new and exciting things we want to add/change within the game.

Big thanks to;

 Xyth for all of his contributions to the community over the years, 
 Guppy for guidance and his amazing microcosm of the 7 Days modding community on his Discord, 
 Valmar for the inspiration,

 and many others for their help/input on getting this mod off the ground.
